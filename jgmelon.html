	<h1>JG Melon</h1>
	<h2>1291 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10021</h2>
	<h3>A New York Staple</h3>
	<img src="images/jgburger.jpg" alt="My Favorite Burger, Ever!!!!">
	<p> JG Melon is a New York staple. Since being founded on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in 1972 it has become one of the most popular and known restaurants in New York.</p>
	<h2>My Review (10/10) </h2>
	<h3>The Experience</h3>
	<p>I love dining at JG Melon! Because it is such a famous establishment  you never know who you'll see when you dine there! The restaurant itself is very small so if you go on a Friday/Saturday expect to wait for your table, but it is well worth the wait! Everyone who works there has been there for a long time, so the entire dining experience has an old-timey feel to it. Every decoration in the restaurant is watermelon themed and it is always smokey and smells of their delicious burgers!</p> 
	<a href="https://jgmelon-nyc.com/menu">JG Melon Menu</a> 
	<p>JG Melon has a rather small menu, but everything on it is delicious! They like to keep things simple. Burgers and Fries, Sandwiches and Steaks and that's about it!</p>
		
	<h3>My Order</h3>
	<p>My favorite thing to order at JG Melon is a Medium-Done Cheeseburger with Lettuce, Tomatoes and Pickles! If I go with someone we will almost always also share an order of cottage fries, and I exclusively drink Pink Lemonade when I'm there. </p>
