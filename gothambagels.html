	<img src="images/bagelpic.jpg" alt="My Go-To: A Plain Bagel with a Fried Egg, Bacon, Cheddar Cheese and Avocado">
	<p> Gotham Bagels was founded by Joey Bagels, a native New Yorker! When Joey came to Madison in 1999 for a teaching assignment he found the city missing one thing, quality bagels!</p>
	<h2>My Review (8/10) </h2>
	<h3>The Experience</h3>
	<p>I think it is important to note that I, myself, am a native New Yorker. I have spent my whole life consuming bagels from famous establishments like Ess a Bagel and Tal Bagels. When I came to Madison in the Fall of 2019 I was expeciting to go MONTHS without a good quality bagel, but to my surprise I found Gotham.The secret to a NY bagel is actually the water, NY water is what makes the bagels so good, so I knew Gotham wouldn;t be as good as I could get in NY, but I think they're somewhere close. The interior looks like you're walking into a NY bagel store which is one of my favorite reasons to go.</p>	
	<h3>The Food</h3>
	<a href="https://www.gothambagels.com/madison-menu">Gotham Bagels Menu</a> 
	<p>Okay, let's talk about the food! The menu at Gotham has practically everything you could order at an authentic NY Bagel Store. From every kind of bagel, to all of the spreads, salads and soups to the cookies, drinks and ambiance.</p>
		
	<h3>My Order</h3>
	<p>My favorite things to order are 1. OMFG* +Avocado and 2. Sesame Bagel with a Fried Egg, Bacon, Cheddar Cheese and Avocado. The OMFG has been my go-to since coming to Madison, but I have recently been trying to make healthier eating choices so I have switched over to the Sesame Bagel.</p>
			
	<p>*OMFG consists of a Fried Egg, Cheddar Cheese, Bacon, Fried Chicken Cutlet and Chili Aioli</p>
