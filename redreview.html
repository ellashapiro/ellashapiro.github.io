	<h1>Red Sushi</h1>
	<h2>316 W Washington Ave #100, Madison, WI 53703</h2>
	<p>BEST SUSHI I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!!!! I have had a lot of sushi in my life and I find it so weird that I am about to say this but, the best sushi I have ever had is in Madison, WI??!!?! Weird, I know. </p>

	<h2>My Review (10/10)</h2>
	<h3>The Experience</h3>
	<p>I have only dined in at Red a handful of times, but I order it for delivery almost every single week and it is just as good as when I dine in. The restaurant itself is kind of small but there are also stools at the sushi bar where you can watch your sushi be made right in front of you, and you don't need a reservation to dine there. I would say Red is definitely a dinner time restuarant rather than a quick bite kind of place, and it is great to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries and any other special occasion!</p>
	
	<h3>The Food</h3>

	<p>Everything here is DELICIOUS! The fish is always extremely fresh and I have never had a bad experience. They have all kinds of cooked and raw sushi rolls, as well as entrees like Salmon and Steak. They also have a lot of yummy sides like shishito peppers and burnt brussel sprouts. </p>
	<h3>My Order</h3>
	<p>My favorite items to get at Red are the Salmon Avocado Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll and Chicken Tempura Roll. They are all sooo good and I can't choose between them!! Red is super filling so I usually only get two rolls or one roll and a side of vegetables or two pieces of nagiri. I also really like the Crispy Rice as an appetizer when I am dining in, it is a cube of sushi rice that is fried and then topped with some spicy tuna and a slice of jalapeno. </p>
